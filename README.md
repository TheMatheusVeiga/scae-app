SCAE - Communication System for the Nursing Area
================================================

Project Description
-------------------

SCAE (Smart Communication System for the Nursing Area) is a web application that aims to revolutionize communication within the health area, specifically catering to the needs of nurses and healthcare professionals. The system provides an intelligent platform for seamless and efficient communication, allowing nurses to collaborate effectively, share critical information, and improve patient care.

The main features of SCAE include:

-   Real-time Messaging: Nurses can exchange messages and updates instantly, promoting quick responses and smoother coordination.

-   Notifications and Alerts: The system will send timely notifications and alerts to keep healthcare professionals informed about important events and changes.

-   Patient Information Management: Nurses can access and update patient information securely and conveniently.

-   Task Assignment: SCAE allows the allocation of tasks among nursing staff, ensuring proper task management and accountability.

-   Data Analysis and Insights: The system provides analytical tools to gain insights from communication patterns and optimize workflow.

SCAE is built using React.js for the frontend, a robust API for handling backend operations, and a database to securely store essential data.
